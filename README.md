## ‚öñÔ∏è My Values
I strongly believe in information sovereignty and that everyone has a right to know exactly what the technology they use is doing with their information, I will refuse to help with anything that is counterproductive to this.

As a mutualist, I believe in the principles of mutual aid and cooperation. That's why I use the Peer Production License for most of my work. This license is designed to promote collaboration and sharing, while still allowing creators to maintain control over their work.
